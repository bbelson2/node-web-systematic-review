    "title": "Big data in manufacturing: a systematic mapping study",
    "abstract": "The manufacturing industry is currently in the midst of a data-driven revolution, which promises to transform traditional manufacturing facilities in to highly optimised smart manufacturing facilities. These smart facilities are focused on creating manufacturing intelligence from real-time data to support accurate and timely decision-making that can have a positive impact across the entire organisation. To realise these efficiencies emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) will be embedded in physical processes to measure and monitor real-time data from across the factory, which will ultimately give rise to unprecedented levels of data production. Therefore, manufacturing facilities must be able to manage the demands of exponential increase in data production, as well as possessing the analytical techniques needed to extract meaning from these large datasets. More specifically, organisations must be able to work with big data technologies to meet the demands of smart manufacturing. However, as big data is a relatively new phenomenon and potential applications to manufacturing activities are wide-reaching and diverse, there has been an obvious lack of secondary research undertaken in the area. Without secondary research, it is difficult for researchers to identify gaps in the field, as well as aligning their work with other researchers to develop strong research themes. In this study, we use the formal research methodology of systematic mapping to provide a breadth-first review of big data technologies in manufacturing.",

    "title": "A Systematic Review of Impediments Blocking Internet of Things Adoption by Governments",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has high promises and might provide many benefits, yet has been given scant attention in e-government literature. Within the IoT, physical objects, “things”, are networked and connected to the Internet. These “things” are able to identify themselves to and communicate with other devices or “things”. There are many impediments blocking the adoption of IoT, and there is limited insight in these barriers. In this paper, impediments for the adoption of IoT are investigated by conducting a literature review and carrying out two case studies. The impediments found in literature were confirmed and extended using the case studies. Results show that impediments are interrelated and occur on the strategic, tactical and operational level. For adoption the impediments needs to be addressed in concert. Research on e-governance can benefit from understanding these interrelated impediments.",

    "title": "Advances in Process Analytical Technology in Freeze-Drying",
    "abstract": "Process analytical technology (PAT) is an integral part of quality by design (QbD), and it allows the online monitoring of critical process parameters to ensure acceptable product quality attributes. This chapter provides a systematic review of latest PAT tools for freeze-drying, with emphasis on suitability for large-scale manufacturing process. Common process monitoring devices such as product temperature sensors (including wireless sensors), Pirani gauge, manometric temperature measurement (MTM), tunable diode laser adsorption spectroscopy (TDLAS), plasma emission spectroscopy (Lyotrack), near-infrared (NIR), and Raman et al. are reviewed in terms of the operation mechanism, major applications, and limitations. These PAT tools are then compared based on their capabilities, practical advantages, and scalability to a large-scale freeze dryer. The criteria of an “ideal” future PAT tool for freeze-drying are then proposed in order to be compliant with the QbD requirements. Finally, the current status of PAT implementation in both development scale and manufacturing scale lyophilizer is discussed, and future implementation of promising PAT tools is proposed.",

    "title": "Advancing e-Government Using the Internet of Things: A Systematic Review of Benefits",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been given scant attention in e-government literature, whereas promises are high. The IoT describes a situation whereby physical objects are connected to the Internet and are able to communicate with, and identify themselves to, other devices. These devices generate a huge amount of data. When it is possible to combine data from devices and other systems, new insights may be created which may provide important benefits. In this paper we explore the expected benefits of IoT for e-governance by investigating case studies at the Directorate General of Public Works and Water Management of the Netherlands. The results show that IoT has a variety of expected political, strategic, tactical and operational benefits which implies that IoT enables effective knowledge management, sharing and collaboration between domains and divisions at all levels of the organisation, as well as between government and citizens.",
